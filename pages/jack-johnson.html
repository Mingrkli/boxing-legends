                       <h3>Early Life</h3>
                        <p>Jack Johnson was born in Galveston Texas in 1878. Son of ex-slaves and was the 3<span class="suffix">rd</span> out of the nine children. He spent his childhood working on boats, sculleries, and a laborer in Galveston to help support his family.</p>
                        <p>Around age 13 his first fight started with his involvement into battle royals where a group of African-American were blindfolded and forced to fight for entertainment in which, Johnson was the last man standing most of the time.</p>

                        <h3>Eye on the Champion</h3>
                        <p>At age 16, Johnson was traveling on his own and started his first professional fight around this time with a fellow longshoreman which wasn't much money however Johnson jumped at the chance and won the fight. Not long after he even fought some rounds against professional boxer Bob Thompson</p>
                        <p>You see, boxing in early years was considered as the white man's domain so black boxers were heavily restricted therefore, no many were able to come to light. So, white tough man and crude brawlers were praised and were stars in those days. However, nothing goes unnoticed when a black fighter with such talent and craft as rumors spread all around as Johnson was starting to make an appearance.</p>
                        <p>Johnson was one of the first people to master boxing in which would lead him to travel around the country to show his fighting superiority and humiliating his white opponents. Defeating one after the next with such confidence, as there will be no mercy coming form Johnson as he knocked them to the ground.</p>

                        <p>As no opponents were able to match Johnson, he started going after the heavyweight champion title. Johnson challenged the champion as this time, James J. Jeffries. However, Jeffries denied since he would refused to fight as he thought the title was too prestigious for black fighters saying <q>this fellow Johnson is a fair fighter but he is a black and for that reason I will never fight him</q>.</p>
                        <p>Since the retirement of Jeffries since there were no more white fighters to fight, the champion title goes to Tommy Burns, and now the eye is on Burns as Johnson is going to fight him for the title. However Burns was the same as Jeffries so he denied the fight however, a wealthy man offered Burns something that he can't refused. The man offered 30 thousand dollars however, this wasn't the part where Burns couldn't refuse, no, it was the fear that people would know that Burns was afraid of Johnson.</p>
                        <p>As the battle was confirmed, everyone was buying tickets, reporters, and camera crews where coming to catch this moment as this was the first championship fight between black and white fighters.</p>

                        <h3>Awakening</h3>
                        <p>On 26 December 1908 the fight between Jack Johnson and Tommy Burns was on. As the fight have started, within a few seconds Burns was on the ground, getting up and getting knocked down again and again. Johnson was having a great time as he would just play with the champion, laughing and talking to the crowd. After a few rounds of toying around, Johnson decided it was time to go on the offense in which leads to Burn took a beating which police force all the cameras to shutoff and stopped the fight. The world was shocked that a black man knocked out a white man, and they denied access to this historical moment out of fear.</p>

                        <p>However, that didn't stop the news, the local chats about a black champion, and quite a lot of white supremacists can't believed that a Negro who had worldwide fame, wealth, tailored suits, automobiles, and now the most prized possession in all of sports, and hurt the moral purists more than anything was that he openly consorted with and married a white woman. Johnson lived as a free man with life treats as fights would be rigged and if he won, there will be consequences. However, Johnson didn't care so he just beat up the other opponent.</p>

                        <p>White people started to call out for hope, someone to defeat the champion, someone to bring back the belt to it's rightful ethnic group. Therefore James Jeffries has returned and was the first hope of the white people, the one to defeat Johnson as the white race depended on it. On 4 July 1910, the fight has finally happened the battle between the champion Jack Johnson and James Jeffries, the fight of the century. After 15 rounds Jeffries was bleeding and swollen beaten to the ground. Near the end of the fight, Johnson smashes Jeffrey through the ropes in which, the most unusual thing happened in all of heavyweight history. Jeffries boxing corner and some media went to help Jeffries up as in desperation for a win however, that didn't stop the knockdowns from Johnson. Jeffries later said <q>I couldn't have hit him. No, I couldn't have reached him in 1,000 years</q>. As Johnson had won, nobody cheered as if people gotten a wake up call or an awakening. In which leads to trouble starting throughout the cities in the East and South as the white society has lost and took there disappointment on the blacks.</p>

                        <h3>The Scheme</h3>
                        <p>Since they can't beat Johnson inside the ring they found a way to beat him outside it as he was put under deferral indictment on the grounds that he transported white women across state lines for immoral purposes. Sadly Johnson was convicted by an all white jury in which still had that race difference as slavery was still massive at that time and sentenced to a year in deferral prison in which Johnson was forced to flee the country to avoid prison time. During the 5 years he was exiled from his own home, Johnson only fought 5 more times during this period as his bank account is drying up as well as his fighting skills. The whites have found there new hope, Jess Myron Willard or known as the Pottawatomie Giant and sent him out to fight Johnson in Havana Cuba in 1915. Sadly, Johnson an out of shape 37 year old boxer have lost the title to Willard.</p>
                        <p>Soon later, Johnson have decided to return back to his home and submitted to the law which he did his time without complaints. He continued to fight for 16 years after his lost to willard and competed in exhibitions until the time of his death on 10 June, 1946.</p>
